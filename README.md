# Simple-YOLO-v1-implementation-from-scratch-using-PyTorch-
This repository implements [YOLO-v1]([https://example.com](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640)) from scratch — the foundational one-shot object detection algorithm — replicating the original paper's architecture as closely as possible.
Additionally, it is beginner-friendly compared to other implementation repositories, offering a well-guided implementation in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.
