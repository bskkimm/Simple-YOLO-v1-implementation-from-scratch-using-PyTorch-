# Simple-YOLO-v1-implementation-from-scratch-using-PyTorch-
This repo implements **[YOLO-v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640)** from scratch, replicating the original paper's architecture as closely as possible.

Additionally, it is beginner-friendly compared to other implementation repositories, offering a well-guided implementation in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.
